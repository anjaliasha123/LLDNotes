        <h1> What are design principles?</h1>
        <p>Design patterns help us to identify what a good software design is which helps us to develope softwares that are flexible and easy to understand and maintain.
            Design principles provide common frameworks called - design patterns taht could be used to manage complex software systems.
            One such principle is known as SOLID principle. Design patters are of 3 types: creational patterns, behavioural patterns and structural patterns.

        <h3>Creational Patterns</h3>
        <p>A creational design pattern is any design pattern that concerns how objects in your program are created. These patterns can help you manage the creation of objects as your code becomes increasingly complex.</p>

            <h1>SOLID PRINCIPLES OF OOP</h1>
            <p>Advantages of using SOLID:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Avoid code duplication</li>
                <li>Easy to maintain code</li>
                <li>Easy to understand</li>
                <li>Reduces complexity</li>
                <li>Flexible Software</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>SOLID</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><p><bold>S</bold>ingle Resposibility Principle</p> - Each class should only have a single responsibility </li>
                <li><p><bold>O</bold>pen/Closed Principle</p> - Must be open to extension via inheritance or composition without making changes in the source code.</li>
                <li><p><bold>L</bold>iskov Substitute Principle</p>- If two objects implement the same interface, we should be able to substitute one for another, without breaking the app.</li>
                <li><p><bold>I</bold>nterface Segmented Principle</p> - coding against the interface. Code should only use interfaces that it depends on.</li>
                <li><p><bold>D</bold>ependency Inversion Principle</p>- All parts of the system should depend on abtracts/interfaces and not the other way round.</li>

            <h3>Single Resposibility Principle</h3>
            <p>A class should be responsonsible only to do a certain job. It should not be responsible to perform other things.</p>
            <pre>
                //Item class
                public class Item {
                    String name;
                    double unitPrice;
                    Item(String name, double unitPrice){
                        this.name = name;
                        this.unitPrice = unitPrice;
                    }
                }
                //Invoice class
                public class Invoice{
                    public Item item;
                    public double totalPrice;
                    Invoice(Item item, double price){
                        this.item = item;
                        this.totalPrice = price;
                    }
                    public double totalPriceCalc(int quantity){
                        return item.unitPrice*quantity;
                    }
                
                    public void printInvoice(){
                        //print invoice
                    }
                    public void saveToDB(){
                        //save to database
                    }
                }
            </pre>
            <p>In the above two classes, the Invoice class is responsible to calculate the total price of the item, print the invoice and to save the invoce details in the database. However, it is possible that additional details
                maybe required to be printed in the invoice later or the invoice needs to be saved in a file instead. Hence the Invoice class violates the SOLID principle.
                Hence, we should split the responsibility of the invoice class into multiple different classes.
            </p>
            <pre>
                public class Invoice{
                    public Item item;
                    public double totalPrice;
                    Invoice(Item item, double price){
                        this.item = item;
                        this.totalPrice = price;
                    }
                    public double totalPriceCalc(int quantity){
                        return item.unitPrice*quantity;
                    }
                    
                }
                class InvoiceSave{
                    Invoice invoice;
                    InvoiceSave(Invoice i){
                        this.invoice = i;
                    }
                    public void saveToDB(){
                        //save to database
                    }
                }
                class InvoicePrint{
                    Invoice invoice;
                    InvoiceSave(Invoice i){
                        this.invoice = i;
                    }
                    public void printInvoice(){
                        //print invoice

            <h3>Open/Closed For Extension</h3>
            <p>It should be open for extension but closed for modification. It means that sometime you may want to extend the behaviour of a class. So we would add a new method to an already tested class that is live and running. 
                This violates Open/Closed Principle. Rather, we should convert the class into an interface and override the behaviours it has to extend its functionality;
            </p>
            <pre>
                public class InvoiceSave{
                    Invoice invoice;
                    InvoiceSave(Invoice i){
                        this.invoice = i;
                    }
                    public void saveToDB(){
                        //save to database
                    }
                }
            </pre>
            Here, the InvoiceSave is already tested and running. But a new requirement is to save the invoice to a file. Rather, than creating a new method, we could make the InvoiceSave as an intrface with an 
            abstract method saveInvoiceInfo.
            <pre>
                public interface InvoiceSave{
                    public void saveInvoiceData(Invoice invoice);
                }
                
                class saveInvoiceDB implements InvoiceSave{
                    @Override
                    public void saveInvoiceData(Invoice invoice){
                        //sve to DB
                    }
                }
                class saveInvoiceFile implements InvoiceSave{
                    @Override
                    public void saveInvoiceData(Invoice invoice){
                        //sve to file
                    }
                }
            </pre>
